# Plasma-donor-app
This application provides an interface for people who need plasma for treatment of COVID-19 and the people that have them. The registered users are segregated on 
the basis of their blood groups to make the process smoother. There is a proper API Gateway for authentication and security of the application.
The AWS cloud solutions are used here ie., the DynamoDB, the API Gateway and Lambda functions. The web framework used here is the Flask framework. 
The app is deployed to the EC2 instance.
